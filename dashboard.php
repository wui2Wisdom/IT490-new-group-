    <p>This is the Home Page of our Project. We are making it easier for people to keep track of their movies. They are able to search any movie and review it. We also have added the function to favorite the movie and it will show on your profile. Lastly you are able to set status of the movie to (Watched, Plan to Watch, Watching).</p>
